            No longer a science fiction trope, the use of brain reading
            technology has improved hugely in recent years. One of the most
            interesting and practical uses we’ve seen tested so far comes from
            researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne
            (EPFL).
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to a machine-learning algorithm, a robot arm and a
            brain-computer interface, these researchers have managed to create a
            means for tetraplegic patients (those who can’t move their upper or
            lower body) to interact with the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            In tests, the robot arm would perform simple tasks like moving
            around an obstacle. The algorithm would then interprets signals from
            the brain using an EEG cap and automatically determine when the arm
            had made a move that the brain considered incorrect, for example
            moving too close to the obstacle or going too fast.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over time the algorithm can then adjust to the individuals
            preferences and brain signals. In the future this could lead to
            wheelchairs controlled by the brain or assistance machines for
            tetraplegic patients.

            3D printing is an industry promising everything from cheap house
            building through to affordable rugged armour, but one of the most
            interesting uses of the technology is the building of 3D printed
            bones.
            <br />
            <br />
            The company Ossiform specialises in medical 3D printing, creating
            patient-specific replacements of different bones from tricalcium
            phosphate – a material with similar properties to human bones.
            <br />
            <br />
            Using these 3D printed bones is surprisingly easy. A hospital can
            perform an MRI which is then sent to Ossiform who create a 3D model
            of the patient-specific implant that is needed. The surgeon accepts
            the design and then once it is printed, it can be used in surgery.
            <br />
            <br />
            What is special about these 3D printed bones is that because of the
            use of tricalcium phosphate, the body will remodel the implants into
            vascularised bone. That means they will enable the full restoration
            of function that the bone it is replacing had. To achieve the best
            integration possible, the implants are of a porous structure and
            feature large pores and canals for cells to attach to and reform
            bone.

            Researchers said this building material has structural load-bearing

            We can’t seem to live without the internet (how else would you read

            economic and social reasons, but for some the internet just isn’t
            accessible because they have no connection.
            <br />
            <br />
            Google is slowly trying to solve the problem using helium balloons
            to beam the internet to inaccessible areas, while Facebook has
            abandoned plans to do the same using drones, which means companies
            like Hiber are stealing a march. They have taken a different
            approach by launching their own network of shoebox-sized
            microsatellites into low Earth orbit, which wake up a modem plugged
            into your computer or device when it flies over and delivers your

            Fast-charging of electric vehicles is seen as key to their take-up,
            so motorists can stop at a service station and fully charge their
            car in the time it takes to get a coffee and use the toilet – taking
            no longer than a conventional break.
            <br />
            <br />
            But rapid charging of lithium-ion batteries can degrade the
            batteries, researchers at Penn State University in the US say. This
            is because the flow of lithium particles known as ions from one
            electrode to another to charge the unit and hold the energy ready
            for use does not happen smoothly with rapid charging at lower
            temperatures.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, they have now found that if the batteries could heat to
            60°C for just 10 minutes and then rapidly cool again to ambient
            temperatures, lithium spikes would not form and heat damage would be

            Scientists have found a way to attach artificial neurons onto
            silicon chips, mimicking the neurons in our nervous system and
            copying their electrical properties.
            <br />
            <br />
            “Until now neurons have been like black boxes, but we have managed
            to open the black box and peer inside,” said Professor Alain
            Nogaret, from the University of Bath, who led the project.
            <br />
            <br />
            “Our work is paradigm-changing because it provides a robust method
            to reproduce the electrical properties of real neurons in minute
            detail.
            <br />
            <br />
            “But it’s wider than that, because our neurons only need 140
            nanowatts of power. That’s a billionth the power requirement of a
            microprocessor, which other attempts to make synthetic neurons have
            used.
            <br />
            <br />
            Researchers hope their work could be used in medical implants to

            packed full of sensors to send data back to Earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            The same applies in the workplace. Robots can take on the more
            difficult, dangerous and dull jobs to save mankind the trouble and
            risk. They can also theoretically operate more quickly, efficiently
            and with fewer mistakes too.

            You’ve heard of cultured “meat” and Wagyu steaks grown cell by cell
            in a laboratory, but what about other animal-based foodstuffs? A
            growing number of biotech companies around the world are
            investigating lab-made dairy, including milk, ice-cream, cheese and
            eggs. And more than one think they’ve cracked it.
            <br />
            <br />
            The dairy industry is not environmentally friendly, not even close.
            It’s responsible for 4 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions,
            more than air travel and shipping combined, and demand is growing
            for a greener splash to pour into our tea cups and cereal bowls.
            <br />
            <br />
            Compared with meat, milk isn’t actually that difficult to create in
            a lab. Rather than grow it from stem cells, most researchers attempt
            to produce it in a process of fermentation, looking to produce the
            milk proteins whey and casein. Some products are already at market
            in the US, from companies such as Perfect Day, with ongoing work
            focused on reproducing the mouthfeel and nutritional benefits of
            regular cow’s milk.

            Carbon emissions are a huge concern when it comes to commercial
            flights, but there is a potential solution and it has received a lot
            of funding.
            <br />
            <br />
            A £15 million UK project has unveiled plans for a hydrogen-powered
            plane. This project is known as Fly Zero and is being led by the
            Aerospace Technology Institute in conjunction with the UK
            government.
            <br />
            <br />
            The project has come up with a concept for a mid-size plane powered
            completely by liquid hydrogen. It would have the capacity to fly
            roughly 279 passengers halfway around the world without stopping.
            <br />
            <br />
            If this technology could be actualised, it could mean a zero-carbon
            flight with no stops between London and Western America or London to
            New Zealand with a single stop.

            After making its dramatic name change, the company once known as
            Facebook has become Meta. This marks Zuckerberg and his huge team’s
            move into the metaverse – an embodied internet mostly accessed
            through virtual and augmented reality.
            <br />
            <br />
            As part of this move, we will start to see Meta putting more time
            into equipment for accessing this new world – mostly in VR.
            Announced back in 2021, Meta has been developing a new headset under
            the title ‘Project Cambria’.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unlike the brand’s previous VR ventures like the Oculus Quest 2,
            this won’t be a device for the average consumer, instead looking to
            offer the best VR experience they can make
            <br />
            <br />
            The Cambria has been reported to be focused on advanced eye and face
            tracking (to improve accuracy of avatars and your in-game
            movements), a higher resolution, increased field-of-view and even
            trying to make the headset significantly smaller.

            Scientists have found a way to store energy in the red bricks that
            are used to build houses.
            <br />
            <br />
            Researchers led by Washington University in St Louis, in Missouri,
            US, have developed a method that can turn the cheap and widely
            available building material into “smart bricks” that can store
            energy like a battery.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although the research is still in the proof-of-concept stage, the
            scientists claim that walls made of these bricks “could store a
            substantial amount of energy” and can “be recharged hundreds of
            thousands of times within an hour”.
            <br />
            <br />
            The researchers developed a method to convert red bricks into a type
            of energy storage device called a supercapacitor. This involved
            putting a conducting coating, known as Pedot, onto brick samples,
            which then seeped through the fired bricks’ porous structure,
            converting them into “energy storing electrodes”.

        Hey everyone,Welcome to my website. i am Ajay Gupta form
        <a href="https://agrasainboysschool.edu.in/" style="color: #3a8db5">
          Agrasain boys' school</a
        >,studying in class 11 and will be in class 12 officially starting from
        april,2022 .ever since i was in 10 i was always fascinated and
        interested in computer science i was also introduced to programming in
        school and was fascinated by computer and the ever growing technology .I
        always wanted to have an edge over other students and therefore i
        enrolled myself in different courses of web development because i
        believe that getting broader exposure since a very young age would be an
        additional benefit in my long run journey therefore seeking the benefit
        of online courses i enrolled in various courses for HTML,CSS and
        JAVASCRIPT for web development and JAVA and PYTHON for programming
        language.
        <br />
        <br />
        i have done many projects in my past so you can check those out from the
        given link below.
